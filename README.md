Project: Database Driven Full Stack React & Express App!

# Requirements:

🎯 Design a database schema with relationships between tables

🎯 Create a new application with a React client and an Express server
(again, remember the client and the server should be separate)

🎯 Seed the database with data. Either run your SQL queries in Supabase SQL Editor OR use a seed.js file. (if you use the Supabase editor, save the scripts you run in a file in your project, in case you need to rerun them, or we need to duplicate the project)

🎯 Create Express endpoints to handle requests so you can POST and GET the data appropriately for your application.

🎯 Create multiple pages using react-router-dom

    🎯 Create a home page.
    🎯 Create a page to show all the posts and use fetch to call your server to get your data.
    🎯 Create a page where users can create new posts using a form.

I met all the requirements for this assignment.

# Stretch Goals:

🏹 Allow users to "Like" posts and increase the likes

🏹 Allow users to DELETE posts

🏹 Allow users to filter posts in a specific category. Used a query string like /posts?category=education

# Reflections:

What went really well and what could have gone better?

The server side went smoothly, and I still need to improve my understanding of how React works; it's still a little unclear to me how it does things; hence, it is harder to think and come up with solutions to problems.

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission:

Does my component and pages folder make sense, or is there anything else I could have done to improve it?
