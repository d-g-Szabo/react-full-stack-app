# Set-up your database

## STEP 1: PLAN your tables

- Think about how many tables you need
  - Possibly two? One for posts, one for categories?
- How do I connect the tables> Is it many-to-many(junction table) or one-to-many relationships(have one category for many posts)?
- Visually draw your tables on Figma, DrawSQL, or paper!

## STEP 2: Write SQL queries to create your tables and seed the data

## STEP 3: Connect your tables to the server
